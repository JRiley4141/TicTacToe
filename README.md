TicTacToe game created by Jenn Riley(person 1) &amp; Michelle Tran(person 2)

Our program generates a board that allows the user to press numbers 1 - 9 and depending on the number, that will mark the players position with whatever marker they are suppose to be. To run the code, all you need to do is run the make file.
